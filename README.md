This module explores Sets and Dictionaries, two core Python collection types.

⸻

1. Word Frequency Counter
	•	Uses a dictionary (via collections.Counter) to count how many times each word appears in a text.
	•	Example:
Input: "apple orange apple"
Output: apple: 2, orange: 1.

⸻

2. Contact Book
	•	Stores contacts as a dictionary where:
	•	Key = Person’s name
	•	Value = Another dictionary with phone and email.
	•	Supports:
	•	Add
	•	Search
	•	Remove
	•	Exit

⸻

3. Set Operations
	•	Demonstrates mathematical set operations with Python sets:
	•	Union: elements in either set.
	•	Intersection: elements common to both sets.
	•	Difference: elements unique to one set.
	•	Input taken as space-separated items.

4. Mini Project: Address Book
	•	Like the contact book but extended:
	•	Each entry stores address, phone, and email.
	•	Supports:
	•	Add new contact
	•	Update existing contact
	•	Search
	•	Remove
	•	Exit (prints final book)
	•	Uses nested dictionaries to store structured info.

5. Main Menu
	•	A simple text-based interface that lets you run any of the four programs.
	•	Keeps looping until the user chooses Exit.
